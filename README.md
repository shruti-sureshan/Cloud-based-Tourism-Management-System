# Cloud-based-Tourism-Management-System

Cloud based Travel Management System is a cloud based web application for travel agencies. The main objective of this project is to create a fast, effective and reliable working platform to develop a communication system between customers and the agency. The user need to just login into the application and can find the information about the available tours and packages. It also assists in promotion of tourism by providing information regarding different places. Also the user can enter his feedback about the travel and tourism agency. Using Cloud Computing servies allow us to store important data on cloud without the fear of our data getting stolen. Moreover, it also facilitates easy updating and handling of records. The system is secure, intuitive and user friendly. Thus, it is beneficial for both travel management agencies and the customers.<br/>

<h3>Tech stack:</h3> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, AWS RDS<br/>


The project has been designed in such a way that new features and modules can be added to the system in the future as per user requirements. It incorporates cloud-based back-end web design that can achieve in storing large storehouses of data. One can access the travel management office from anywhere on the web and need not visit the travel agency office. The Home page of the project is as shown below:
